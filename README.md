Neither the global settings nor chromesettings (https://github.com/s-fiebig/quick-javascript-switcher/blob/master/core.js#L106) allow to control (i.e., enable/disable without reload) the Javascript engine on the fly as in Opera up to 12.17. 
So long this extension can not be used for my intentions.
